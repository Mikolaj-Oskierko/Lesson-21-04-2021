			<div class="box1"><p>So trying to layout your page and your coding is probably going to be one of the most time consuming and, potentially, frustrating things that you're going to do in this entire course. And that's one one reason why I've left almost this entire week for us to practice laying things out on your page.</p></div>
			<div class="box2"><p>The ideas themselves are very simple and straightforward, but it's the putting them together, as you add more and more to your page, where things can get a little bit tricky. So let's begin talking about the different positioning elements, or, the different positioning properties, that you can use, okay?</p></div>
			<div class="box3">
				<h2>Four positions</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>static</li>
					<li>relative</li>
					<li>absolute</li>
					<li>fixed</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="box4"><p> So you say what kind of position you want the element to be, and then you can say, but I want it to be this far from the top or this high off the bottom, or this far over from the left.</p></div>
			<div class="box5"><p>So let's start with static, and the reason we're going to start with static is because you've already been using it all along. It's what we call the default value for elements. If you don't say anything else, it's going to be set to this. How it works is that the browser is going to place each element in just the next available position. You can give it values such as top, bottom, left, and right, but the browser's going to completely ignore it. How it's going to work is something like this. Let me see if I can draw this up here. Is you've got your screen.</p></div>
